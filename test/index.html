    <p>These tests communicate with a server on a different domain to
      grant access, upon user permission, to a cross-domain shared storage
      area.</p>
    <p>It is hoped that the public API (referenced in the last tests to run)
      might become accepted as a web standard.
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>To run these tests, you must agree to the prompts.</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>In Chrome, you must also ensure that "Block third-party cookies" in
      <kbd>chrome://settings/content/cookies</kbd> is turned off.</em></strong></p>
